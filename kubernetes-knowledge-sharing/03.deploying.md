# Deploying Microservices
Production microservices applications!
A deployment is an orchestration. Tell your deployment the desired state and k8s will take care of it.

Lets have a look at a deployment yaml
```
cat deployments/auth.yaml
```
Start up a deployment
```
kubectl create -f deployments/auth.yaml
```
Check out the deployment status
```
kubectl describe deployment auth
```
###Attach a service to a deployment
create service
```
kubectl create -f services/auth.yaml

kubectl create -f deployments/hello.yaml
kubectl create -f services/hello.yaml

kubectl create configmap nginx-frontend-conf --from-file=nginx/frontend.conf
kubectl create -f deployments/frontend.yaml
kubectl create -f services/frontend.yaml
```
Make sure we are up and running
```
curl -k https://104.197.128.182
```
### lets look at the dashboard
```
kubectl proxy
```
localhost:8001/ui
### Scale your deployment!
Check out how many replicas containers you have of each type
```
kubectl get replicasets
```
Why dont we scale the frontend?
```
kubectl get pods -l "app=hello,track=stable"
vi deployments/hello.yaml
# change the replica field
```
Apply the change (do not re-create pod, thats why we use k8s!)
```
kubectl apply -f deployments/hello.yaml

# now check
kubectl get pods -l "app=hello,track=stable"
# or
kubectl get replicasets
# or
kubectl describe deployments hello
```
### Updates
We need some devops ;). remember that first image!

Major update time
```
vi deployments/auth.yaml
# change version of something
kubectl apply -f deployments/auth.yaml
```
Track deployment progress
```
kubectl describe deployments auth
```
Lets see how long the auth pod has been up...
```
kubectl get pods
```
It worked!
