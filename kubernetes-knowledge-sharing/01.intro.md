# Kubernetes
Open source LXE cluster management tool - Designed by google. Initially released in June 2014, first stable in July 2015. Currently at version 1.3.
Manage deployment of services with high level abstractions.

## Features
Provide "primitives" mechanisms for:
1. Deploying
2. Maintaining
3. Scaling
* * *
## Primitives
#### 1. Pods
One or group of containers deployed on the same host. Pods in a cluster have a unique IP (prevents port conflicts).
#### 2. Labels and Selectors
Allows users or componenets to attach k-v pairs - labels - to API objects in the system. "Label selectors" can have operations run on them
#### 3. Controllers
Controller manage pods based on labels
* Replication Controller : Manages the state of pods. During faults, updating and scaling.
* DaemonSet Controller : How many pods per machine
* Job Controller : Pods that run to completion - batch processes

#### 4. Services
Group of pods that does something... pods that work together. Conventionally share a label.
#### 5. Deployments
Declarative updates for Pods and Replica Sets (replica controller). Use cases include : create deployments of pods and replicas, check success status, recreate pods, rollback earlier deployments, pause/resume deployments

## Architecture
#### Kubernetes Node
Node is a VM or Physical machine that is running Container Runtime (runs docker or other), Kubelet (start stop containers, health check), Kube-Proxy (network proxy and load balancer).
#### Controler Plane
Internal External interfaces of k8s. Save cluster state to etcd (persistent data store). Manages CRUD operations persistency.
