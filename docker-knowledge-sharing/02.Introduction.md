# Advantages of Containers

## Development
1. Isolated : install and run. configs in container
2. Identical Environment : Development - QA - Staging - Production
3. 1 VM : all projects run on containers in that one machine

# Production Advantages
1. Immutable (disposable infrastructure) - dumb containers
2. Portable - everything within containers, agnostic
3. Simple, Fast scaling - just run more containers!
4. Decoupled applications - scale servers separately from applications
5. Cost savings - use 100% of your resources, almost

# Testing / QA / Environment
1. Test production containers before deploying. Deploy same tested containers
2. Easy to create identical envs
3. No complicated provisioning scripts - Full environment setup in one Dockerfile
4. Containers are dynamically configurable - Configure for each environment

# Microservices vs Monoliths

### Problems
* Poor use of hardware resources
* Complexity in development grow exponentially
* New programmers cannot contribute
* Coupled Deployment
